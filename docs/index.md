# Miletic's scientific software consulting services

My name is Vedran Miletic and I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2015 from [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/). Today I am the [principal investigator](https://group.miletic.net/en/people/principal-investigator/) of [GASERI](https://group.miletic.net/en/), a research group working in the fields of computational biochemistry and high-performance computing.

Based on the knowledge and experience I gathered in my group's [research](https://group.miletic.net/en/projects/) [work](https://group.miletic.net/en/publications/), I offer consulting services for scientific software, including [development](#development-and-maintenance), [testing](#testing-and-documentation-writing), [porting](#cross-platform-porting), and [deployment](#integration-and-deployment-scientific-workflow-design-and-automation) for academic and industrial needs.

## My portfolio of prior work

While I contributed to dozens of projects over time, I would like to highlight two:

- [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/), the open-source molecular dynamics simulation software used by my group, which I [develop on an ongoing basis to serve our research requirements](https://group.miletic.net/en/people/principal-investigator/#gromacs), and
- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), the collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies, which I [patched to improve AMD Radeon Graphics Processing Unit and Instinct Accelerator support](https://group.miletic.net/en/people/principal-investigator/#llvm).

For more details and other projects, see the complete listing of [contributions to open-source software](https://group.miletic.net/en/people/principal-investigator/#open-source-software-contributions).

## The services I offer

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### Development and maintenance

    ---

    I offer development and maintenance services for open-source or in-house developed scientific software. The services I offer include, but are not limited to:

    - adding a new feature, for example, developing a new module that implements a particular method,
    - improving existing functionality or fixing a known issue, for example, changing the software to remove limitations for solving a particular problem,
    - refactoring and modernizing the source code, for example, evolving from C++98 with dependency on legacy libraries and build systems to [C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17)/[C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20) with modern [open-source libraries](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs) and [build](https://cmake.org/) [systems](https://mesonbuild.com/),
    - extending the application programming interface (API) for your particular requirements.

- ### Testing and documentation writing

    ---

    I offer to write new and improve existing unit, system, regression, and mutation tests for existing scientific software. I also offer build matrix and testing pipeline design for various software as a service (SaaS) and self-hosted continuous integration (CI) tools.

    I offer writing user- or developer-oriented documentation for existing scientific software, including the documentation of application programming interfaces (APIs). I also offer a setup of the documentation build process for producing printable and web-friendly output from the common source, with the style that matches your taste.

    For a portfolio of prior technical writings, see my posts on [GASERI blog](https://group.miletic.net/en/blog/). For an example of a produced (API) documentation, see [RxDock documentation](https://rxdock.gitlab.io/documentation/devel/html/) and [its API documentation](https://rxdock.gitlab.io/api-documentation/devel/html/).

- ### Cross-platform porting

    ---

    I offer software porting of existing scientific applications and libraries from and to Linux, [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)/[NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/), Solaris/[illumos](https://illumos.org/), macOS, and Windows, including [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/), [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)/[Mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), and [WSL](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-subsystem-for-linux/9P9TQF7MRM4R). For example, [my portfolio](#my-portfolio-of-prior-work) contains fixes to numerous issues related to porting GNU/Linux- and x86/AMD64-focused open-source scientific software such as [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/), [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/), and [RxDock](https://rxdock.gitlab.io/) to various other operating systems, compilers, and platforms.

- ### Integration and deployment; scientific workflow design and automation

    ---

    I offer integration of existing open-source applications and libraries into your workflow, including deployment of server-side software on your on-premise or cloud infrastructure.

    I also offer assistance in choosing specific open-source software for your scientific workflow and workflow design and its automation.
